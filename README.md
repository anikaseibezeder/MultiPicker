## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

```
https://github.com/anikaseibezeder/MultiPicker.git
```

## Usage

1. Add a `Set`, which will later on hold the selected values.

```swift
@State private var selection = Set<String>()
```

2. Add the `MultiPicker` to your view by providing a `title`, the `selection` Set, an array containing the available `options` 
   and what you want to use as the label of those options.

```swift
private let options = ["Option 1", "Option 2"]

MultiPicker("Options",
            selection: $selection,
            options: options) { $0 }
```

## Styling

### DefaultMultiPickerStyle

> Displays the options similar to the default `SwiftUI Picker`.

#### Properties

* `allowsMultipleSelection` - define if the Picker should allow multiple selection

#### Apply by adding

```swift
.multiPickerStyle(DefaultMultiPickerStyle(allowsMultipleSelection: true))
```


### GridPickerStyle

> Displays the options in a grid.

#### Properties

* `columns` - define how many columns should be used to display the options
* `allowsMultipleSelection` - define if the Picker should allow multiple selection

#### Apply by adding

```swift
.multiPickerStyle(GridPickerStyle(columns: 5, 
                                  allowsMultipleSelection: true))
```
